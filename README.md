# Thyssen Málaga Bot (DAHSS19)

The <A HREF="http://historiadelartemalaga.uma.es/dahss19/">Digital Art History Summer School 2019 (DAHSS19)</A>, organized by the University of Málaga, created a dynamic and interactive Twitter bot that offers helpful information about the artworks in the <A HREF="https://www.carmenthyssenmalaga.org/">Carmen Thyssen Museum, Málaga</A>. One piece of artwork each day. In total 254 works will be shown to a worldwide audience. To attract more art lovers to interact with our bot, we designed some simple and fun questions. 
Feel free to view it! <a href="https://twitter.com/thyssenmlgbot">Click here</a>.

We have been using Natural language processing (NLP) to create hashtags and summaries from the description text and composed flashcards with the average colour of the images as background. <!--For more information, see our presentation [here].--> The full code can be found here.
