# DAHSS19

The <A HREF="http://historiadelartemalaga.uma.es/dahss19/">Digital Art History Summer School 2019 (DAHSS19)</A>, organized by the University of Málaga, created a dynamic and interactive Twitter bot that offers helpful information about the artworks in the Carmen Thyssen Museum. One piece of artwork each day. In total 254 works will be shown to a world-wide audience. To attract more art lovers to interact with our bot, we designed some simple and fun questions. 
Feel free to view it! <a href="https://twitter.com/thyssenmlgbot">Click here</a>.

We have been using Natural language processing (NLP) to create hashtags and summaries from the description text and composed flashcards with the caverage colour of the images as background. <!--For more information, see our presentation [here].--> The full code can be found at here.
