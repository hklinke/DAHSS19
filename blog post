A twitter bot of Carmen Thyssen Museum is born! 
The Digital Art History Summer School 2019, organized by the University of MÃ¡laga, created a dynamic and interactive Twitter bot that offers helpful information about the artworks in the Carmen Thyssen Museum. One piece of artwork each day. In total 254 works will be shown to a world-wide audience. To attract more art lovers to interact with our bot, we designed some simple and fun questions.
